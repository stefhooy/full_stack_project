# AI Game Analyst — frontend

The Next.js UI for [AI Game Analyst](../README.md). See the repo root README
for the full project (backend, agent, evals) and PLAN.md/DOCEXP.md for the
roadmap and engineering log. This file covers just this app.

## Dev

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # points at http://localhost:8000 by default
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires the backend running (see the root README) — this app calls it
directly via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, no server-side proxy.

## What's here

- `app/page.tsx` — the whole UI: example questions, input, streamed
  progress, answer, chart/table, stats result.
- `lib/api.ts` — hand-rolled SSE parsing over `fetch` (not `EventSource`,
  which can't send the POST body the question needs) against the backend's
  `/ask/stream` endpoint.
- `components/Chart.tsx` — bar/scatter rendering via Recharts, styled from
  the validated default palette (single hue — every question produces at
  most one series, so no categorical palette or legend is needed).

## Deploy

See the root README's "Deploying" section — this app deploys to Vercel
with `frontend` set as the project's root directory.
